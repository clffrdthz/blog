      <a href="lanay.html" class="post-title"><center>"Annabelle Rama: Reason of Sarah and Richard's split up?"</center></a><br> <br>
      <p class="post-description">It seems like the season of breakups continues in the second week of December, as numerous speculations on the rumored split of Sarah Lahbati and Richard Gutierrez continue to make noise in entertainment circles.

    
        Though neither Lahbati nor Gutierrez have yet to confirm the split, the issue is further marred by the veiled word war between their in-laws, Gutierrez’s mother, screen veteran-talent manager Annabelle Rama, and the actress’ father Abdel Lahbati.
        Meanwhile, Joshua Garcia is caught in the breakup of Kathryn Bernardi and Daniel Padilla as he branded as “fake news” reports linking Padilla to Andrea Brillantes. Meanwhile, Brillantes’ mother went out of her way to defend her daughter on social media.
        On the other hand, Heaven Peralejo opened up about initially wanting to quit showbiz,While Annabelle Rama did not confirm the breakup rumors hounding the marriage of Gutierrez with Lahbati, the Gutierrez matriarch disclosed that the actor has been staying in her house for a month now.
        Rama said this after she was asked about Richard and Lahbati’s relationship status, in an exclusive interview by ABS-CBN reporter MJ Felipe last Dec. 7.“Hindi pa ko pwede magsalita eh pero sasabihin ko sa ‘yo, si Richard na sa akin ngayon,” she said, saying Richard will move to a house in Alabang after Christmas. Rama further revealed that the couple’s two sons, Zion and Kai, are currently with her son. As for the rumors of a feud between her and Lahbati, she said, “Hindi ko siya nakakausap. Wala akong time makipag-usap sa kanila.”
        Rama, without directly naming the actress, then told Felipe, “Nakikita mo naman ‘diba?… Si Richard trabaho nang trabaho, ‘yung isa nagwawaldas ng pera. ‘Yun lang ang masasabi ko diyan.”Rama added that despite working tirelessly, Richard was welcomed with “dispute” after he returned to Manila. The celebrity mom also revealed that the whole Gutierrez family, except for one, whom she didn’t name, will celebrate the holiday season in Japan.
        “Maghintay na lang kayo kasi malalaman niyo rin. Not now,” Ramad was quoted as saying.Richard and Lahbati, who got married in March 2020, welcomed their firstborn Zion in 2013 and their second child Kai in 2018. They have yet to address the breakup allegations, as of this writing.
        Breakup speculations have been hounding them since November, after netizens noticed that the pair have only shown photos of their individual bonding moments with their sons on their respective social media pages.

    <p class="post-description">‘Gigil na ako isiwalat ang katotohanan’

        Annabelle Rama slammed rumormongers who accused her of being the reason behind Gutierrez’s falling-out with Lahbati.A day after she broke her silence on the breakup speculations hounding Richard and Lahbati, Rama addressed the netizens via her Instagram page last Dec. 8, telling them to stop spreading “false stories.”
        Rama stressed that the public should not put the blame on her on the matter as she had no idea how everything happened so fast.“Sino ba ang may gustong maghiwalay sila? Ako ba? Or ang mag-ina?” she stated. “Nagulat na lang ako biglang dumating ang nanay at tatay galing ibang bansa. Doon na nag umpisa ang malaking gulo. Wag niyo ibagsak sa akin ang sisi.”
        While Rama did not name who were the individuals she was referring to, it can be noted that Lahbati has been frequently seen spending time with her parents—Moroccan dad Abdel and Filipino mom Estrella.“Kung hindi ako pinagbawalan ng lawyer na magsalita, mag-enjoy sana ang buong mundo sa sasabihin kong kwento. Gigil na gigil na akong isiwalat ang katotohanan sa pangyayari pero wala akong magawa,” Rama added, teasing netizens to “watch out for the next chapter.”
        “Basta ako ayaw ko silang maghiwalay [dahil] mahal ko ang mga apo ko,” she stressed.

    <p class="post-description">Sarah’s dad hits at ‘dogs barking’
        Netizens were intrigued after Sarah Lahbati’s father, Abdel, dropped a cryptic remark on not minding the “dogs barking,” on Instagram last Dec. 9.His post showed a glimpse of what seemed to be an intimate get-together with his family, where Sarah and her sons Kai and Zion were present.
        “Enjoying every moment with family. The convoy keeps going and don’t mind dogs barking,” he wrote, although he didn’t address anyone in particular.Abdel’s post, however, caught the attention of netizens in the comments, with some speculating that he might be referring to his daughter’s mother-in-law, seasoned actress Annabelle Rama.
        Others thanked Abdel for showing his support to his daughter amid her apparent marital woes, while some hoped that Sarah and Richard’s parents would leave the pair alone to work on their relationship.Without revealing who he was pertaining to, he nonetheless thanked netizens for their “love and support” in the comments.
