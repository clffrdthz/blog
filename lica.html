               <p>The Facebook and Instagram pages of Gomez mostly showed screenshots of his supposed conversations with Budol, with whom he appeared to have an intimate affair. It is unknown, however, if the images were edited or tampered in some way.

While the posts have been taken down, social media users have been able to save copies of it and have been reuploading them online.

Gomez's alleged conversation with Budol, his co-star in the television series Magandang Dilag, implied that the two had a sexual encounter with each other.

At one point, Budol appeared to open up the topic on Gomez’s daughter with his partner Shaila Rebortera. “What if makakasama mo lang [si Amelia] kapag naging kayo ulit ni Shai? Paano ako? Ay ‘pag dumating ‘yung point na ‘yun, okay lang sa’kin,” one of her supposed messages read. “Wag ka na magpaalam, wala ka na kailangang i-explain. Iintindihin ko lang lahat. Alam ko pinasok ko. Alam ko limit ko.”

Gomez previously kept his family a secret from the public, saying in his interviews that he was single.

Rebortera eventually revealed in August this year that they already have an eight-month-old daughter named Amelia as she accused Gomez of physically and verbally abusing her. She has since separated from the actor and has been living with their daughter.

Gomez later confirmed Rebortera’s accusations in a now-deleted apology letter posted on Instagram, where he wrote, “I'm sorry for hurting you babe. I love you so much. I'm sorry for all the pain and hurt that I caused. For raising my voice. For not being honest and not reassuring you that I am yours.”

In another supposed exchange with Budol, Gomez appeared to air his ill feelings toward Rebortera amid her revelation of his alleged abusive behavior, saying, “Inayos ko nga interviews ko, ‘di pa rin siya masaya. As in gusto niya sabihin ko na sinaktan ko siya. Literal. Gusto niya sirain ko sarili ko. Anong klaseng relasyon ‘yun?”

“Ako gusto ko lang sabihin mo, love mo ako, paglalaban kita char hahaha,” Budol replied.

Budol also appeared to discuss the possibility of her getting pregnant with Gomez.

“Rob, what if seryoso?” Budol’s alleged text read. “Kung ano ‘yung possible na maging resulta, nandyan ka pa rin sana. Sana kung anong maging resulta, nandyan ka pa rin. Kinakabahan na naman ako.”

A picture of a pregnancy test with a negative result was then included in the chat.

Aside from Budol, Gomez also allegedly planned to hang out with Manalo in secret, as implied in their alleged exchange on Instagram and Telegram.

“You didn’t reply on Telegram. Meron ka na naman na pick-up na ibang girl noh,” the Binibining Pilipinas Universe 2009 titleholder's supposed message for Gomez read.

In another alleged conversation, Manalo’s text read, “Kaya mo pumunta that early? 7 am? Brought my dogs here sa Makati. Let me know para I can go back to BGC early to see you before I leave at 10 am.”

“He’s not here. He’s in Valenzuela,” she added.

Manalo has been in a longtime relationship with Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian. The two became tight-lipped about their romance until November 2019, when they celebrated their first anniversary together.

Neither Gomez, Budol, nor Manalo have commented on their alleged leaked conversations.

Aside from Magandang Dilag, Gomez is also known for his roles in Lovers/Liars, Shake Rattle and Roll: Extreme, and Daddy’s Gurl.</p>
